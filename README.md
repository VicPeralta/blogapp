# Blog app

A blog app built using Ruby on Rails that allows you to make posts about anything you want.

You can also use the application API to query about posts of an individual author, check the post's comments, and even make a new one.

You need to register with your email and password. After completion, you will receive an email asking you to confirm your account. In that email, you will also receive your API token to use the API.
